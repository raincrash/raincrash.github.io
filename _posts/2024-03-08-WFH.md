## 4 Years of Remote Work

![blog_cover](/assets/wfh/image_blog.png)

Four years ago, I entered the world of remote work, marking a significant shift in my professional life. It all began as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic while I was working on my master's thesis from home. Little did I know that this initial adaptation would transform into a lifestyle.

In this journey, I found myself exploring new routines, seeking motivation, and discovering ways to collaborate in this evolving work dynamic. Along the way, I stumbled upon a few realizations.

For instance, beyond the unexpected expenditure of my excessive coffee consumption habits over these years, the years spent working from home felt short and somewhat blurry. The virtual environment, with its inherent monotony, has the peculiar ability to distort our perception of time over weeks.

In response to this realization, I proactively introduced measures to break the monotony, such as scheduling in-person social interactions two to three times a week. This deliberate effort helped disrupt the relentless pace and inject a sense of variety into my daily routine.

Reflecting on these changes, I decided to write this post about some of the lessons I have learned along the way while working remotely from home over the past four years.

## The Balancing Act of Remote Workplaces

### Maintaining Visibility

In the world of remote work, making sure others see and recognize your efforts takes some thoughtful steps.  I learned that staying visible in remote work involves using digital tools, being active in virtual meetings, and keeping everyone updated on your work.  Since we're not physically present, it's essential to proactively communicate through digital tools like Slack and emails. Regularly updating colleagues and managers about what you're working on helps them stay in the loop.

Being part of virtual meetings is crucial for staying visible. It's not just about showing up but actively participating— turning the camera on, sharing ideas and contributing to discussions. This not only shows your dedication but also strengthens connections within the remote team. These interactions provide insights into everyone's work, creating a sense of unity and progress.

Alongside digital communication and virtual meetings, keeping everyone posted on your project's progress is vital. Clearly communicating milestones, challenges, and achievements ensures everyone is aware of what's happening. This transparency not only makes you more visible but also contributes to a well-informed and connected remote work environment.

### Setting Boundaries

Making sure work doesn't creep into personal time (and vice versa) is essential for a balanced remote work life. It's like putting up invisible walls to avoid unnecessary interruptions. Here's how I am trying to do it:

**Define Work Hours:** Being clear about when you're on the clock and when you're off. Set specific work hours and stick to them. This helps create a routine and ensures you have dedicated time for work.

**Create Dedicated Workspace:** Having a specific area for work helps mentally separate your job from your personal life. It could be a desk, a corner of a room, or any spot where you 'go to work.' When you're there, it's work time.

**Communicate Your Availability:** Let the team know if you are off for a couple of hours. Let your colleagues (and family) know when you're available and when you need focused time. This way, they'll understand when it's okay to interrupt and when you need uninterrupted work.

Setting boundaries boils down to creating a clear distinction between your work hours and personal time. It's about ensuring you have the space and time you need to be productive while still enjoying a healthy work-life balance.

### Nurturing Collaborative Relationships

I realised that building strong connections within a virtual team takes intentional effort. Nurturing collaborative relationships is all about creating a friendly and supportive team atmosphere. Regular interactions, both work-related and casual, contribute to better teamwork and make your virtual work experience more enjoyable.

Just because you're not in the same office doesn't mean you can't have coffee breaks together. Schedule a virtual coffee chat with a colleague. It's a casual way to catch up and build a friendly connection.

You can also take the time for informal check-ins. It's not always about work. Ask your colleagues how they're doing or share a bit about your day. These small conversations go a long way in building camaraderie.


### Managing Workload Effectively

Juggling tasks effectively becomes even more crucial when working remotely.

**Task Breakdowns:** When you're not in a physical office, it's essential to know and communicate what needs your attention first. Prioritizing tasks helps you focus on what matters most, ensuring you stay on track.

Remote work often involves tackling projects more independently. Breaking down bigger tasks into smaller, more manageable parts makes the workload less daunting.

In the absence of face-to-face collaboration, project management tools become even more important. They help communicate, keep everything organized, from to-do lists to project timelines, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

**Setting Realistic Expectations:**  Remote work allows for autonomy, but it's vital to understand your own capabilities. Setting realistic expectations involves recognizing what you can achieve within a given timeframe and aligning your goals accordingly, and the ability to communicate it well. Setting expectations is a two-way street and mismatched expectations is even more dangerous while working remotely. Communicating transparently with stakeholders, whether it's your team or clients, ensures everyone is on the same page.


### Embracing Flexibility

One of the perks of remote work is the ability to set your own hours. Finding the hours when you're most productive contributes to better work outcomes.

**Leveraging Asynchronous Communication:** Remote work transcends traditional office hours, making asynchronous communication a powerful tool. Embrace the freedom to communicate on your own time, allowing for thoughtful responses and reducing the pressure of immediate replies.

Finding the right balance between structure and adaptability is the key to a successful remote work experience. Embracing flexibility doesn't mean sacrificing organization; rather, it's about creating a work environment that aligns with the team and your lifestyle - allowing for seamless adjustments as needed.

**Navigating Time Zones and Global Collaboration**:
For those engaged in global collaboration, navigating different time zones becomes an integral part of the balancing act. Setting clear expectations regarding response times, and fostering a global mindset contribute to seamless collaboration across borders.

### Social Interactions and Post-Work Routine

I've come to realize the vital role social interactions play in maintaining good mental health, especially when faced with the challenges of working remotely. Despite the inherently solitary nature of working from home, I've learned the value of actively pursuing social connections beyond the confines of work hours.

The lack of a commute and the comfort of my home office provided me with the flexibility to make spontaneous plans and engage in social activities that might not have been feasible otherwise. This newfound freedom extends to exploring and working from new cities, as well as enjoying more quality time with friends and family.

While remote work fosters a social post-work routine, it's essential to **strike a balance**. Setting boundaries ensures that work commitments don't encroach on personal time, and vice versa. This balance allows me to enjoy the best of both worlds—productive workdays and vibrant social interactions.

### Longing for Office Interactions

Remote work, with all its conveniences, still falls short in replicating the vibrant atmosphere of traditional office interactions in some situations. The impromptu chats, coffee break banter, and chance encounters with colleagues contribute to a unique sense of camaraderie that virtual platforms struggle to fully emulate. Admittedly, I find myself missing these moments from time to time.

**Substituting with Virtual Connection:** While virtual platforms can't entirely replace face-to-face interactions, there are creative ways to foster a sense of connection in the remote landscape. Scheduled virtual coffee breaks, casual team check-ins, or dedicated channels for non-work-related conversations can provide a space for informal bonding.

**Team Onsites:** To address the yearning for office interactions team onsites provide valuable opportunities for face-to-face connections, team-building activities, and the spontaneous interactions that make traditional office life so memorable.


## What Next?

As the work landscape continues to evolve, adaptability remains crucial. Looking forward to the future of remote work, there are several aspects I aim to incorporate into my routine. One key focus is having a more structured physical activity routine, and actively being involved in a in-person hobby group.

Looking forward!
