Hi there, I'm Sricharan Chiruvolu (Sri), an AI Research Engineer currently living in Munich, Germany. I specialize in 3D Computer Vision and Machine Learning, building scalable ML solutions that bridge research and real-world applications.

With experience spanning both startups and large enterprises, I've worked on diverse projects from sports analytics to virtual avatars for workplace learning, fashion and AR/VR. I hold a Master's in Computer Science from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I focused on computer vision and graphics.

I'm always up for interesting discussions over coffee ☕ or potential collaborations. Let's connect:
