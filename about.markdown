Hello there!

My name is Sricharan Chiruvolu, but you can also call me _Sri_.

I specialize in **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and creating **software solutions at scale**.

Currently, I am based out of Munich, Germany.

I have held several positions as a software/computer vision engineer, including full time roles at [Meshcapade](), [SAP](), and [Runnr/Zomato](), as well as stints at [Siemens](), [Lexoro](), [Allianz](), and [TUM]().
