Hi there! I'm Sricharan Chiruvolu (Sri), an AI Research Engineer based in Munich, Germany. My expertise is in computer vision, 3D reconstruction, and generative modeling, where I develop scalable machine learning solutions that bridge cutting-edge research with real-world applications.

With experience across startups and large enterprises, I've worked on a wide range of projects, from sports analytics to virtual avatars for workplace learning, as well as full-body avatars in fashion and AR/VR. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), specializing in computer vision and graphics.

I’m always open to interesting discussions over coffee ☕ or exploring potential collaborations. Let’s connect:
