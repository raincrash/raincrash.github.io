Hey there, I'm `Sricharan Chiruvolu` - but you can call me `Sri`.

I'm a `Munich`-based software engineer who specializes in `3D computer vision` and `machine learning`.

Currently, I'm a `Senior Computer Vision Engineer` at [Sporttotal](https://sporttotal.com/). Previously, I was at [Meshcapade](https://meshcapade.com/).

I hold a master's degree in computer science from the `Technical University of Munich (TUM)`, majoring in computer vision and graphics. During this time, I was also at [Siemens](https://siemens.de/) (3D Computer Vision).
